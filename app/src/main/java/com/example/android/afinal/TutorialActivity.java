Players only need to twist the forearm inward to drive the wrist, instead of largely swing the entire arm. With this technique, players can easily make crosscourt shots or slice shots by slightly adjusting the angle of the racket surface and their strength. ");

At the initial movement, the right foot should move half a step in front of the left foot, to help turn the body. Hit the backhand at the same time as the final step lands on the ground. This not only helps generate power, but also makes it easier to return back after the shot. \n" +

With more practice, players can allow the movement of the swing to be smoother. Preparatory action should be kept small, and there should be a stopping of arm movement during the instant of contact.
